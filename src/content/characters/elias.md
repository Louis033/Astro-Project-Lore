## Background
Elias is a beggar in the Economic District’s Undercity, where he also gathers information and sells it for money.

He is one of the earliest residents of the Undercity. His previous life remains uncertain—his stories about it often change, perhaps intentionally—but one thing is certain: he once belonged to a life of wealth and comfort.

Elias became an information broker, inspired by the real beggar factions of the Upper City. However, he answers only to the Warden and [Zero]. Common people are unaware that such an information broker even exists.

He was the one who found, raised, and named [Zero] when the child first appeared in the Undercity under mysterious circumstances. No one truly knows where [Zero] came from—not even Elias himself. He searched for the truth for years, digging through countless pieces of information, yet never found a clear answer.

Despite this, Elias raised [Zero] as his own child. He often told him stories about the Upper City, guided him on how to survive, and advised him on how one day he might escape the Undercity.
