## Background

Zero is a bookkeeper for the Warden of the Religia economic district’s Undercity. He was recruited at a young age after the Warden recognized his intelligence, exceptional memory, and natural talent with numbers. Over time, Zero became indispensable, often helping the Warden manipulate records and alter ledgers to deceive the Upper City.

Long before that, however, Zero first appeared in the Undercity under mysterious circumstances.

He was found as a very young child—able to stand and speak, yet unable to recall anything about his past. No records showed his arrival. He had not been sold, sentenced, or exiled like the others. One day, he was simply there. Traumatised, silent for days, and hollow-eyed, as if his life had begun only moments before he was discovered.

Because he seemed like a blank slate—an existence that started from nothing—the people of the Undercity called him Zero.

He was taken in by a man named [Elias], a laborer who raised him as his own. [Elias] became Zero’s father figure, teaching him how to survive the Undercity and offering him something rare in that place: kindness without expectation. To this day, [Elias] remains the closest thing Zero has to a family.

Zero’s remarkable aptitude surfaced early. Numbers came naturally to him, and his memory was unnervingly precise. These traits eventually drew the attention of the Undercity’s Warden, who recruited Zero into his service—not as punishment, but as an asset.

Despite his position, Zero despises the Undercity. He dreams of escaping to the surface to build a better life for himself and his foster family. His loyalty to the Warden is not born of respect, but of necessity—his family was spared only because Zero agreed to serve. In return, he secretly assigns them safer tasks suited to their abilities, keeping them alive within a system designed to exploit them.

Once, Zero was allowed to visit the city above. There, he witnessed a vastly different way of life—clean streets, abundance, and freedom. That brief glimpse hardened his resolve. He swore he would return someday, not as a visitor, but as a free man.

However, escape is impossible. The people of the Undercity are bound by an invisible seal, treated as living assets of the Warden, forced to work until their value is exhausted. The only way to break the seal is to kill the Warden himself.
