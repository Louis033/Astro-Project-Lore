## Richard’s Observation

The Life Tree is a part of nature that is believed to have existed since the very beginning of Aesleth. According to the earliest recorded texts—many of which are based on even older tales from the Old World—the Life Tree was already present at the dawn of time, its roots spreading across the world.

Its leaves emit a faint silver glow, a phenomenon believed to originate from the tree’s continuous process of supplying Mana to the world—the very source of magic. In many ways, it is as if life itself flows from the Life Tree. This belief is the reason why, since ancient times and across many languages, it has come to be known simply as the *Life Tree*.

Aside from the great Life Tree itself, there exist several minor Life Trees scattered across the world. These lesser trees also provide Mana, though not with the same strength or abundance. Each Life Tree possesses a certain area of influence, within which Mana naturally flows. For this reason, regions where a Life Tree grows have historically become sites of constant conflict.

This pattern was broken only when Religia was built upon the Life Tree. To this day, no force has dared to challenge it directly. Religia is known to be exceptionally blessed with Mana, a fact often cited as one of the primary reasons behind its advanced civilization—particularly in military strength, economic growth, technology and education.

Regions that fall outside the influence of the Life Tree’s Mana are known as *Barren* lands. In modern times, however, various technologies—such as Mana Crystals—have been developed to compensate for this absence. The Undercity is one notable example of a Barren region, as Mana becomes increasingly thin the deeper—or higher—one travels away from the Life Tree’s influence. Much like oxygen, Mana becomes scarce beyond a certain threshold.

## The Death of a Life Tree

The Life Tree is believed to be nearly indestructible; few, if any, forces are capable of harming it. This is not the case for the minor Life Trees. Due to their weaker Mana flow, certain weapons or methods are said to be capable of destroying them.

There exists an ancient record describing a time when a minor Life Tree was completely severed down to its roots. As a result, the surrounding region lost nearly all ability to utilize Mana. This event marks the only known instance in which members of the *Unlightened* class perished—not by direct force, but through the collapse of Mana itself.

The consequences were catastrophic. A civilization that relied heavily on Mana suddenly lost its source of power, and chaos ensued. The society ultimately collapsed.

To this day, however, no region has been conclusively identified as the site of a destroyed minor Life Tree. Due to the age of the documents, the lack of empirical evidence, and the myth-like nature of the account, many scholars believe the story may be exaggerated—or entirely fictional. It is also possible that, given enough time, the tree eventually regrew.

From this source alone, several conclusions may be drawn: there exists a method by which the Unlightened can perish; a minor Life Tree can, in theory, be destroyed; and, perhaps most intriguingly, such a tree may be capable of growing again.
