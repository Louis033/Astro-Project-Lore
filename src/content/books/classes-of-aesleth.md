# Class

A Class is a transcendental state of existence achieved after the payment of an irreversible price.  
Those who obtain a Class are no longer considered mortal beings, regardless of their original species.

A Class does not directly represent raw power.  
Instead, it grants **existential authority**, unlocking innate abilities and passive traits that reshape how the individual interacts with reality.

Raw power is determined by the number and quality of claimed souls, while Class Level defines the **form** through which that power manifests.

# Unlightened

## Class Trigger
To become an Unlightened, an individual must already have achieved Class Level 1 and activate the **Ritual of Death**, either as a prepared ritual or while the subject is deceased within a limited time window.

Those who possess another Level 1 or more Class and later undergo the Ritual of Death may also become an Unlightened.  
However, doing so will result in the **complete loss of all previous class traits**, leaving only the traits of Unlightened.

---

## Traits
An Unlightened at Level 1 attains immortality.  
It can no longer die, yet it is no longer alive.

The physical body of an Unlightened suffers from perpetual hypothermia, ranging from mild to severe depending on the number of souls consumed.  
This cold is not merely environmental, but existential—an unending chill that continuously inflicts pain upon the body.

Over time, this condition erodes the mental stability of the Unlightened, resembling prolonged torture combined with an ever-present thirst for killing.

Due to its cold nature, an Unlightened possesses natural resistance—scaling with Class Level—against cold-based magic.  
Fire magic is highly effective against Unlightened, while light magic is exceptionally destructive.

Unlightened possess no natural predators, yet they are widely regarded as the most unstable and self-destructive Class within Aesleth.

The physical manifestation of Unlightened includes pale skin, dark rashes, and dulled emotional expression, the result of constant pain suppression.

# Hero

## Class Trigger
To become a Hero, an individual must already have achieved Class Level 1 and activate the class through the **Hero’s Oath**.

The oath binds the subject’s existence to the concept of confrontation and resolution, rather than morality.

---

## Traits
A Level 1 Hero naturally gains heightened perception, granting superior reaction speed and increased awareness of imminent danger.

Heroes possess a neutral elemental nature.  
They exhibit no inherent elemental weaknesses and do not deal increased damage against any specific element.

Additionally, Heroes develop heightened empathy, allowing them to sense emotional states in others with unnatural clarity.  
This does not compel compassion, but rather understanding.

# Faithful

## Class Trigger
To become a Faithful, an individual must have already achieved Class Level 1 and undergo a **Mana Exposure Ritual**.

This ritual does not grant power.

Instead, it subjects the candidate to an overwhelming concentration of raw mana, introduced through prepared catalysts such as potions, crystals, or direct mana transfer from other individuals.

The process is extremely painful and frequently lethal, resembling an acute metaphysical infection.  
Survival marks the individual as a Faithful.

---

## Traits
Faithful are beings whose bodies have developed **partial immunity to mana toxicity**.

They do not command mana naturally, nor are they favored by it.  
Rather, their bodies have learned to endure its presence without immediate collapse.

As a result, Faithful are capable of utilizing **all forms of magic**, provided they possess sufficient knowledge and technique.

Their limitation lies not in access, but in **biological and existential tolerance**.

---

## Mana Affinity Burden
Each type of magic carries its own affinity residue, which accumulates within the Faithful’s body through repeated use.

These residues behave similarly to a chronic condition:
- weakening the body
- destabilizing casting
- increasing the risk of backlash

Different affinities accumulate independently and cannot be suppressed simultaneously.

---

## Stabilization Rituals
Faithful must perform **periodic stabilization rituals** to suppress accumulated affinity residue.

Each ritual is limited in scope and can only alleviate the burden of a single affinity.  
Rituals cannot be performed continuously and typically require a fixed interval between executions.

Residual affinities must be endured until properly addressed, placing Faithful in a constant state of calculated risk.

---

## Existential Nature
Faithful are not conduits of magic, but **hosts**.

Their power lies in endurance, discipline, and restraint rather than dominance.

Those who fail to manage their affinity burden inevitably suffer physical collapse, mental degradation, or catastrophic mana rejection.

# Tenebrae

## Class Trigger
To become Tenebrae you must already achieve level 1 and undergo an oath of shadow.

## Traits
Tenebrae is have a thinner presence than others 

They have a superior information senses too, they could see better in the dark, and they could hear better too even accross a thich wall. 

The setback is Tenebrae cannot be exposed to light, whether natural or magic, for a certain time period of time or it's debuffing his traits. So they weak againts light element.
