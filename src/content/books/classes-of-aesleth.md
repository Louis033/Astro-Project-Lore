# Class

A Class is a transcendental state of existence achieved after the payment of an irreversible price.  
Those who obtain a Class are no longer considered mortal beings, regardless of their original species.

A Class does not directly represent raw power.  
Instead, it grants **existential authority**, unlocking innate abilities and passive traits that reshape how the individual interacts with reality.

Raw power is determined by the number and quality of claimed souls, while Class Level defines the **form** through which that power manifests.

# Unlifa

## Class Trigger
To become an Unlifa, an individual must already have achieved Class Level 1 and activate the **Ritual of Death**, either as a prepared ritual or while the subject is deceased within a limited time window.

Those who possess another Level 1 Class and later undergo the Ritual of Death may also become an Unlifa.  
However, doing so will result in the **complete loss of all previous class traits**, leaving only the traits of Unlifa.

## Traits
An Unlifa at Level 1 attains immortality.  
It can no longer die, yet it is no longer alive.

The physical body of an Unlifa suffers from perpetual hypothermia, ranging from mild to severe depending on the number of souls consumed.  
This cold is not merely environmental, but existential—an unending chill that continuously inflicts pain upon the body.

Over time, this condition erodes the mental stability of the Unlifa, resembling prolonged torture combined with an ever-present thirst for killing.

Due to its cold nature, an Unlifa possesses natural resistance—scaling with Class Level—against cold-based magic.  
Fire magic is highly effective against Unlifa, while holy magic is exceptionally destructive.

Unlifa possess no natural predators, yet they are widely regarded as the most unstable and self-destructive Class within Aesleth.

The physical manifestation of Unlifa includes pale skin, dark rashes, and dulled emotional expression, the result of constant pain suppression.

# Hero

## Class Trigger
To become a Hero, an individual must already have achieved Class Level 1 and activate the class through the **Hero’s Oath**.

The oath binds the subject’s existence to the concept of confrontation and resolution, rather than morality.

---

## Traits
A Level 1 Hero naturally gains heightened perception, granting superior reaction speed and increased awareness of imminent danger.

Heroes possess a neutral elemental nature.  
They exhibit no inherent elemental weaknesses and do not deal increased damage against any specific element.

Additionally, Heroes develop heightened empathy, allowing them to sense emotional states in others with unnatural clarity.  
This does not compel compassion, but rather understanding.
