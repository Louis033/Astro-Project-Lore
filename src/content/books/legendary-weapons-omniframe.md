Omniframe is a unique weapon belong to a legendary mercenary, Physcx. It’s a Magniton based weapon and it’s consist of many weapon frame so it could construct or decontruct to make a weapon of many kind. 

The magniton nature being magnetic is a great advantage of Omni-frame as it could be triggered to construct a weapon type assisted by an AI powered system to automatically form on its own made by Physcx himself. 

Omni-frame on it’s own made by an unknown legendary craftsmen that want to make a melee/range weapon in single weapon. The first prototype of omni-frame is created in the old world era and only could change from sword and a throwable small knives, and when change ownership either from lose battle or stolen the design is keep improving and finally nowadays is held by Physcx which he made an AI powered System that could automated change weapon on its own.

**Description:**

A single blade segment assembled with minimal Magniton activation. Extremely fast deployment and low mana consumption.

**Notes:**

- Near-silent assembly
- Can be formed while moving
- Lowest system footprint

**Tenebrae Usage:**

Preferred for silent eliminations.

Often deployed before the target realizes a weapon is present.

## **CONFIG-02 : Modular Sword**

**Role:** General combat, adaptive engagement

**Description:**

Blade segments aligned along an extended shaft. Magniton nodes maintain rigidity without mechanical locking.

**Tenebrae Usage:**

Selected when distance determines survival.

All blade modules combined into a heavy striking platform. High mana draw and longer assembly time.

**Tenebrae Usage:**

Rarely authorized.

High visibility contradicts Tenebrae doctrine.
