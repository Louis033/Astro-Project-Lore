## The Nullifier

**The Nullifier** is a daemon-forged blade anointed by a crystal of the **Daemon Codex**.  
Forged from **Harmonia Ingot**, the sword possesses the ability to neutralize mana in all its forms, without exception. The blade itself holds no inherent anti-mana properties; its material exists solely as a flawless resonant medium, capable of synchronizing with mana without distortion.

The weapon’s true power originates from the Codex’s blessing. Upon contact, the embedded Codex crystal enforces a nullification effect, causing external spells to collapse and violently destabilizing mana circulating within living targets. Mana does not vanish—it is forcibly invalidated, resulting in severe internal backlash.

The Nullifier cannot be enhanced by any form of mana infusion. Instead, each instance of mana nullification demands mana directly from its wielder, consuming the user’s own reserves to sustain the effect.

The Nullifier is not a weapon that overpowers magic. It is a verdict against reliance on mana itself.


## Veritas

**Veritas** is a daemon-forged rapier anointed with a symbol of the **Daemon Codex** embedded within its hilt.  
Forged from **Harmonia Ingot**, the rapier stands as a symbol of divine truth—one that may appear slender and unassuming, yet is capable of piercing anything with unwavering precision.

Veritas grants its wielder unparalleled penetration, governed entirely by the user’s mana concentration. Rather than relying on brute force, the blade enforces a singular vector of passage, allowing it to ignore armor, barriers, and physical mass.

The rapier is currently wielded by the leader of the **Religia Inquisitors**. In ancient times, Veritas was traditionally entrusted to religious leaders or holy warriors, serving as both a sacred relic and an instrument of judgment.

With sufficient mana and focus, Veritas can penetrate not only its primary target but continue through aligned targets beyond. Without proper concentration, its extraordinary effect collapses, leaving the blade no different from an ordinary rapier.
