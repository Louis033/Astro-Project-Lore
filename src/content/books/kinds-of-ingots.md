# Non-Resonant Ingots

**Non-Resonant Ingots** are standard industrial materials that exhibit **no interaction with mana**. They remain mechanically and energetically stable under all known mana conditions, making them the backbone of modern industry and weapon manufacturing.

Unlike Resonant materials, Non-Resonant Ingots do not absorb, amplify, store, or respond to mana in any measurable way. This predictability makes them essential for **structural integrity**, **safety**, and **control** in systems that otherwise rely on volatile mana-based components.

> In mana-integrated weapon systems, Non-Resonant Ingots serve as the *anchor* that prevents cascade failure.

**Primary Uses:**

* Weapon frames and internal structures
* Casings and outer shells
* Barrels and mechanical housings
* Structural components for modular systems

## Steel Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Basic structural material

**Description:**
Reliable and easy to process, steel ingots form the backbone of most conventional weapons and industrial machinery. Their mechanical behavior is well understood, making them a default choice for large-scale production.

**Common Use:**

* Weapon frames
* Blades
* Barrels
* Armor plates

---

## Titanium Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Lightweight structural material

**Description:**
Titanium ingots offer a high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance. They are preferred in advanced or mobile weapon platforms where mass reduction is critical.

**Common Use:**

* Internal frames
* Structural connectors
* Advanced weapon housings

---

## Tungsten Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** High-density material

**Description:**
Extremely dense and highly resistant to heat, tungsten ingots are used where impact force, thermal stability, or recoil management is required.

**Common Use:**

* Penetrator cores
* Counterweights
* Recoil stabilizers

---

## Aluminum Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Lightweight industrial material

**Description:**
Lightweight and corrosion-resistant, aluminum ingots are easy to shape and manufacture. While mechanically weaker than steel or titanium, they are effective for non-critical components.

**Common Use:**

* Outer casings
* Secondary frames
* Non-critical weapon parts

---

## Copper Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Conductive material

**Description:**
Copper ingots provide excellent electrical conductivity while remaining completely mana-inert. They are commonly used to isolate mana flow rather than transmit it.

**Common Use:**

* Wiring
* Grounding layers
* Mana-insulation paths

---

## Lead Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Shielding material

**Description:**
Dense and malleable, lead ingots are effective at blocking harmful emissions, including mana radiation, without any resonance.

**Common Use:**

* Shielding layers
* Secure containers
* Restricted weapon storage

---

## Ceramic Composite Ingot

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Anti-penetration material

**Description:**
Hard and brittle composite material designed to absorb and fracture incoming force. Often used in layered protection systems.

**Common Use:**

* Armor inserts
* Heat shields
* Protective housings

---

## Carbon Composite Block

**Type:** Non-Resonant
**Role:** Lightweight composite material

**Description:**
Carbon composite blocks offer high tensile strength with minimal weight. Fully mana-inert, they are favored for concealed or modular equipment.

**Common Use:**

* Weapon panels
* Concealment-grade equipment
* Modular shells

---

## Engineering Note

> **Non-Resonant Ingots are mandatory in all mana-integrated weapon systems.**
> Resonant components must be structurally isolated within Non-Resonant frameworks to prevent instability, uncontrolled resonance, or catastrophic failure.




# Resonant Ingots

**Resonant Ingots** are specialized materials that exhibit **measurable interaction with mana**. Unlike Non-Resonant Ingots, these materials respond to mana excitation by altering their physical or energetic behavior.

Because of their unstable and reactive nature, Resonant Ingots are **never used as primary structural materials**. Instead, they function as **cores, triggers, or control elements** within larger systems supported by Non-Resonant frameworks.

> In modern engineering doctrine, Resonant materials provide *function*, while Non-Resonant materials provide *stability*.

**Primary Uses:**

* Activation mechanisms
* Control nodes
* Modular weapon systems
* Mana-reactive components

---

## Magniton Ingot

**Type:** Resonant
**Resonance Class:** Directional Magnetic Resonance

**Description:**
Magniton is a mana-reactive ingot that exhibits magnetic attraction exclusively toward other Magniton materials when mana is supplied. In its inert state, Magniton behaves like a dense but otherwise unremarkable metal. When mana is injected, its internal structure polarizes, enabling controlled attraction and alignment.

Unlike conventional magnetism, Magniton interaction is:

* selective (Magniton-to-Magniton only)
* inactive without mana input
* tunable through mana allocation

**Resonant Behavior:**

* Mutual attraction between Magniton nodes when mana-triggered
* Polarity can be altered through controlled mana flow
* Attraction strength scales with mana input

**Common Use:**

* Modular weapon assembly systems
* Self-aligning frames
* Recall-capable weapon components
